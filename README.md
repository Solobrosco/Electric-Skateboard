# Electric-Skateboard

This is the repository for the creation of a DIY Electric Skateboard.

The Idea
From a skateboarded perspective I would like a good sized board to tavel on. A board that feels completely the same, but with the added power of electic motors. A board that is light enough to carry around and still do tricks.
Possibilities


Choices of boards
Boards sizes generaly come in 3 catagories; small, short and long. The faster you are willing to go the bigger the board to get. A wide base of support is necessary to comfortabley maneuver the skateboard at high speeds.  


Equipment
- Longboard
- Suspension trucks
- Battery Pack
- Motors
